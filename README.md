The Use Of REST Conventions:

REST API is a Representational State Transfer => 
     It transfers data instead of a User Interface,
	
     Unifor Interface: Clearly defined API endpoints with clearly defined request + response data structure.
	
     Stateless Interactions: Server and client don't store any connection history, every request is handled seperately.
	
     Cacheable: Servers may set caching headers to allow the client to cache responses.
	
     Client and server are separated, client is not concerned with persitent 
	
     Server may forward requests to other API's.
